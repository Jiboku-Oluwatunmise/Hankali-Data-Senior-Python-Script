# Hankali-Data-Senior-Python-Script
These curated Python scripts train Hankali Intel's Data Senior Class from basic to intermediate data analysis. They cover Python fundamentals, NumPy for scientific computing, and Pandas with Matplotlib and Seaborn for data manipulation and visualization. The program equips learners with practical skills for data handling and interpretation.

## Python Fundamentals
**Objective**: Build a solid foundation in Python programming.
**Key Concepts**:
Python basics: variables, data types, and operators.
Control structures: loops (for, while) and conditionals (if-else).
Functions and modules: creating reusable code.
Basic file handling: reading and writing text files.
Introduction to Python libraries: installing and importing packages.

## NumPy for Scientific Computing
**Objective**: Introduce NumPy for efficient numerical computations.
**Key Concepts:**
Creating and manipulating arrays.
Array slicing, indexing, and broadcasting.
Common array operations: aggregation functions (sum, mean, etc.).

## Pandas for Data Manipulation
**Objective**: Teach learners how to handle, clean, and manipulate data with Pandas.
**Key Concepts**:
DataFrames and Series: creating and accessing data.
Indexing, filtering, and slicing DataFrames.
Handling missing data: identifying, removing, and imputing.
Data transformation: sorting, grouping, and merging.

## Data Visualization with Matplotlib and Seaborn
**Objective**: Equip learners with skills to visualize and interpret data effectively.
